## About The Model

Using Support Vector Machine the model predicts whether a customer is suitable for approval of the loan.
Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning. The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best hyperplane that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future.SVM chooses the extreme points/vectors that help in creating the hyperplane. These extreme cases are called as support vectors, and hence algorithm is termed as Support Vector Machine.
